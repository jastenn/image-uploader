Introduce your projects by taking a screenshot or a gif. Try to tell visitors a story about your project by answering:

- Where can I see your demo?
- What was your experience?
- What have you learned/improved?
- Your wisdom? :)

Through this project I learned a lot since this is the first my node application. I also learned about file/image handling and using templating engine using pug. Also with this project, my knowledge in deployment become broader. It also refreshes my knowledge on using vanilla javascript as I am used to Javascript Frameworks.
